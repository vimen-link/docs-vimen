# Introduction to Vimen

Vimen Dynamic and Deep Links are blazing fast, cheap and easy to use links for mobile apps.

As a developer you will be able to:
- Measure **links performance**, hence evaluate ad campaigns (How many clicks? How many installs? etc.)
- Create sophisticated **experiences** for your users with ease (open your app directly on a given page)
- Have your users always land on the **right mobile store**
- Build **user relation graphs** ("Alice shared a song with Bob, they must be friend!")
- **Save money** on your monthly bill

## Concepts

To make the set-up journey truly smooth, it's recommended you familiarize first with certain concepts:

- **Deep Link**: a deep link is a link capable of opening a specific app at a specific page or route when interacted from a mobile device (which has such app installed)
- **Dynamic Link**: is a link that will redirects users to different destinations based on different criteria. For instance, you might want Android users, that don't have your app yet, to be redirected to the Android Play Store page of your app (more complex behaviors can be configured)
- **Surviving Installation**: is the capability of a dynamic link of bringing a payload with it, and preserve it even after the installation process, so that you can later perform operations with it (for instance you can verify that Bob installed your app with the link that Alice shared, how nice of Alice!)
- **App-Domain Association**: we will handle this for you, but it's beneficial to be aware that your app can only be opened from links that are "white listed", for security reasons

## Implementation path

### 1. Setup your project and links on vimen.io
### 2. Configure your app
### 3. Handle deep & dynamic links in your app
### 4. View analytics data
### 5. Configure webhooks for advanced use cases
