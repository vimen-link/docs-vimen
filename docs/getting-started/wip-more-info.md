### Configure iOS app (optional)

Your Vimen links all share the same structure:

```
{your-project-slug}.vimen.io
{your-project-slug}.vimen.io/products/games/zelda
{your-project-slug}.vimen.io/76tyfvgbkh
...
```

**`{your-project-slug}.vimen.io` constitutes your base domain**

Our plugin is open source and is based on another great open source flutter
plugin: [app_links](https://pub.dev/packages/app_links). This documentation
contains link and inspiration from Apple Documentation, Android Documentation
and app_links readme file.
